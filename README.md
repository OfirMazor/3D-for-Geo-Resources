## Python for 3D Geometry:

[Trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh) - Pure Python library for loading and using triangular meshes with an emphasis on watertight surfaces. The goal of the library is to provide a full featured and well tested Trimesh object which allows for easy manipulation and analysis, in the style of the Polygon object in the Shapely library.

[Pymesh](https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - A rapid prototyping platform focused on geometry processing.

[Geometry3D](https://geometry3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Geometry3D is a simple python computational geographics library written in python.

[Libigl](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/) - A simple (C++) geometry processing library

[meshplot](https://github.com/skoch9/meshplot/) - Plot 3D triangle meshes

[Py3DViewer](https://py3dviewer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - Python library based on Numpy for fast prototyping of geometry processing algorithms.

[cadquery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python library for building parametric 3D CAD models.



## SQL for 3D Geometry:

[PostGIS 3D functions](https://postgis.net/docs/PostGIS_Special_Functions_Index.html#PostGIS_3D_Functions) - PostGIS Functions that support 3D geometries.



## Software for 3D Geometry

[FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) - Open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size.
